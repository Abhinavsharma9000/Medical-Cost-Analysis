# 🏥 Medical Cost Analysis

This project explores and analyzes medical insurance cost data to identify key factors that influence healthcare expenses. The objective is to build insights that can help insurance companies make data-driven decisions and optimize healthcare resource allocation.

## 📌 Project Overview

Medical costs are influenced by several factors including patient demographics, medical history, and treatment procedures. In this project, we:

- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand cost distributions.
- Identified key drivers of medical expenses such as **age, BMI, smoking status, and region**.
- Built a **predictive regression model** to estimate insurance costs based on various patient attributes.

## 📊 Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive development
- **Machine Learning** – Linear Regression, Model Evaluation Metrics
- **Data Visualization** – for pattern and outlier detection

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Smokers have significantly higher insurance charges compared to non-smokers.
- Age and BMI have a positive correlation with medical costs.
- Regional differences in cost distribution highlight potential policy and pricing strategy improvements.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Statistical Analysis & Correlation Mapping
- Regression Modeling
- Data Visualization and Interpretation
- Business Understanding and Insight Generation
